Overlays for Retroarch / Retropie / Recalbox ... 

What is this?
This is my contribution to the Retro community. It is a collection of overlays that I (Louis Stice) created for the following portable systems:
 * Atari Lynx I
 * Atari Lynx II
 * Nintendo Game Boy
 * Nintendo Game Boy Advance
 * Nintendo Game Boy Color
 * Game Gear

Why?
Because the existing overlays for these systems have very jagged edges. I worked very hard to smooth every curved edge on all of the provided pictures while maintaining accuracy.

I scoured the Internet for very high resolution pictures of these systems. I then worked to ensure the viewport for the game was centered and the system was accurate.

All images are labeled as follows:
* Game system - Integer Display multiplier (Actual resolution of gameplay rectangle.)
Example:
 Game Boy Color 5x5 (800x720) - Teal
 This overlay is for the Game Boy Color
 The intended emulation resolution for the screen is an integer 5 x 5.
 This translates to a resolution of 800x720.

There are multiple resolutions available for each overlay, depending upon how you want to play.
 * Most start at 3x3 resolution, with the smallest screen, and largest area for the game system.
 * They go up to almost full-screen.
 * The Game Gear has a few smaller screens with a fuzzy background to emulate a sitting environment.

Some files also include nuances to the overlay. Here are some examples.
* Atari Lynx II-6x6-rounded
   - Rounded corners for the Atari Lynx
   - The emulation rectangle has a rounded corner for the display
* Atari Lynx II-6x6-rounded-fixed logos
   - The corners are rounded and the system logo was moved so it wasn't clipped, or only half showing.
* Atari Lynx I-8x8-square-fixed logos
   - The corners are square, and the logo is fixed
* Game Boy Color 6x6 (960x864) - Berry - Clipped Logo
   - The GBC logo is clipped, only half showing
* Game Boy Color 6x6 (960x864) - Grape - No Logo
   - The GBC logo is removed
* Game Boy Color 6x6 (960x864) - Clear - Fixed Logo
   - The GBC logo is moved and resized to remain visible.

Game Gear Notes
The existing Game Gear image was incorrectly squished. When I started this project, the Game Gear emulator incorrectly used square pixels. The aspect ratio is really 1.33. (4:3). The provided image was askew to make it appear to be correct.
I found a straight-on view and correctly provide a 4:3 aspect ratio for the game.

Game Boy Color Notes
I tried to find an original, large picture from which I could create the overlays. However, not all systems were available. In those instances, the image was color shifted to match the intended system. This worked surprisingly well! 

I have worked to ensure color accuracy for the following GBC systems:
  - Atomic Purple
  - Berry
  - Black
  - Clear Green
  - Clear
  - Daiei
  - Dandelion
  - Grape
  - Kiwi
  - Pokemon Gold
  - Pokemon Silver
  - Pokemon Yellow
  - Teal
I created this color combination because I liked how it looked:
  - Clear Cyan

More Systems
I am not interested in making more of these for other systems at the moment. However, if a very high-resolution image is provided, I may find time to fix it up into an overlay.

Usage:
You may use these images in any compilation, granted that (Louis Stice) is given credit for the editing of the image. I do not know who the original authors are of the original photographs. If you are the original author of the high-resolution picture, please contact me and I will add your name as author of the original image. Additionally, please contact me for any commercial use.
